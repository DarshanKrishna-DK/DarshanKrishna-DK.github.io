        the information you allowed us to collect from those third parties to facilitate account
        creation and logon process for the performance of the contract.
        ■ To post testimonials. We post testimonials on our Website that may contain personal
        information. Prior to posting a testimonial, we will obtain your consent to use your
        name and the consent of the testimonial. If you wish to update, or delete your

        3. WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE?
        In Short: We only share information with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you
        with services, to protect your rights, or to fulfill business obligations.
        We may process or share your data that we hold based on the following legal basis:
        ■ Consent: We may process your data if you have given us specific consent to use
        your personal information for a specific purpose.
        ■ Legitimate Interests: We may process your data when it is reasonably necessary to
        achieve our legitimate business interests.
        ■ Performance of a Contract: Where we have entered into a contract with you, we may
        process your personal information to fulfill the terms of our contract.
        ■ Legal Obligations: We may disclose your information where we are legally required
        to do so in order to comply with applicable law, governmental requests, a judicial
        
        proceeding, court order, or legal process, such as in response to a court order or a
        subpoena (including in response to public authorities to meet national security or law
        enforcement requirements).
        ■ Vital Interests: We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to
        investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential violations of our policies,
        suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person and
        illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.
        More specifically, we may need to process your data or share your personal information in
        the following situations:
        ■ Business Transfers. We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or
        during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition
        of all or a portion of our business to another company.
        ■ Vendors, Consultants and Other Third-Party Service Providers. We may share your
        data with third-party vendors, service providers, contractors or agents who perform
        services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that
        work. Examples include: payment processing, data analysis, email delivery, hosting
        services, customer service and marketing efforts. We may allow selected third
        parties to use tracking technology on the Website, which will enable them to collect
        data on our behalf about how you interact with our Website over time. This
        information may be used to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine
        the popularity of certain content, pages or features, and better understand online
        activity. Unless described in this notice, we do not share, sell, rent or trade any of
        your information with third parties for their promotional purposes.
        ■ Business Partners. We may share your information with our business partners to
        offer you certain products, services or promotions.
        
        4. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?
        In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined
        in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes
        set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law
        (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require
        us keeping your personal information for longer than 90 days.
        
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information,
        we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example,
        because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will
        securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until
        deletion is possible.
        
        5. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?
        In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational
        and technical security measures.
        We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed
        to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our
        safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the
        Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we
        cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third
        parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or
        modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information,
        transmission of personal information to and from our Website is at your own risk. You
        should only access the Website within a secure environment.
        
        6. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a
        Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference
        not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this
        stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has
        been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other
        mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a
        standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you
        about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.

        7. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?
        In Short: Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.
        We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated
        by an updated “Revised” date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is
        accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by
        prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We
        encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently to be informed of how we are
        protecting your information.
